# JHU-Coursework-Scripts
# 
### An assortment of ad-hoc scripts I've written to help with assignments for courses I'm taking as M.S. Bioinformatics student at Hopkins
### Script purpose and content varies, and as this repository is new there is currently no method to my madness.
### Use at your own leisure and risk.
